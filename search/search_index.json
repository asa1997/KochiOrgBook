The mission of the ToIP foundation is to simplify and standardize how trust is established online so that everyone can feel safe, secure, and private in all of our digital interactions \u2014 whether between individuals, businesses, governments, or any \u201cthing\u201d on the Internet of Things. DID \u2013 Decentralized Identifier DIDs are globally unique identifiers that are created by their owner, independent of any central authority. Each DID has associated with it one or more public keys created by the DID owner (and the owner holds the corresponding private keys), and one or more endpoints - addresses where messages can be delivered for that identity. A DID can be uniquely resolved (like a URL) to return the the data (public keys and endpoints) associated with the DID. Agents and Wallets It is hard to manage all the DIDs a person creates or receives. Indy uses the term \"Agent\" to mean the software that interacts with other entities, and the term \"Wallet\" as a data store for the DIDs and related information. For example, a person might have a mobile Agent app on their smart devices, while an Organization might have an enterprise Agent running on a Cloud Server. All Agents have a secure Wallet for storing identity data. A personal Agent wallet is similar to a password manager - there is a name for each relationship and associated data. However, unlike Password Managers that use things like your copy/paste clipboard for User IDs and Passwords and \"screen-scrape\" applications and websites, Agents communicate directly with Agents to accomplish Identity-related tasks. The picture below is an example of some communicating Indy Agents. The Edge Agents are handled by the Identity owners themselves - in this case a Consumer and an Enterprise. The Cloud Agents facilitate the messaging by, for example, providing a permanent endpoint for a device that may or may not be online at the time messages are being received. Credential Credentials are things like driver's licenses, passports, or university degrees that are given to us from an issuing authority that we can use to show to others when needed. Verifiable Credential(VC) VCs are digital equivalents of paper credentials that are cryptographically processed such that when we show (\"prove\") the claims (data elements from the Credentials), the receiver (\"Verifier\") can be certain: - Who issued the claims - That the claims were issued to the Identity presenting them - That the claims have not been tampered with (forged), and - That the claims' Credential has not been revoked by the Issuer. As the image below shows, the data flow for Verifiable Credentials is the same as with paper documents - Issuers give Verifiable Credentials to the Holder, and the Holder can prove them to Verifiers at any time. Issuer, Holder, Verifier Issuer - Issues Verifiable Credentials to the Holder Holder - Holders request credentials from issuers, hold them in their wallets and present them when requested by verifiers Verifier - Verifies the claims presented by the Holder TIP \u2013 Trust over IP Interoperability Profile\u200b A TIP represents a specific combination of technologies that span each of the four layers of the ToIP technology stack in order to meet the requirements of a set of target customers in one or more digital trust ecosystems. TIPs can be designed, refined and supported by multiple vendors and customers wishing to collaborate on interoperability. TSWG \u2013 Technology Stack Working Group\u200b This working group (members) concerns a broadly defined and broadly applicable set of technologies (the \"stack of technology\") that can be used to promote the ability of project-level scientists to build web-based data and processing services that are readily found and used by others. Part of this effort is to promote interoperability between individual services in order to help scientists pursue more integrated science. GDPR - General Data Protection Regulation\u200b General Data Protection Regulation is meant to fundamentally reshape how personal data are collected and processed by giving all individuals living in the European Union (or the greater European Economic Area) new rights to access and control their data on the Internet.

Digital Trust Ecosystem An interdependent group of enterprises, people and/or things that share a standardized trust model for mutually beneficial purposes, such as consumer and commercial interactions that are verifiable. DID Namespace Building on URI Standards, the DID Specification allows for both root namespace (did:xxx) and sub-namespace (did:xxx:yyy) conventions.

A few of the key use cases are listed below. Medical Practitioners Verifiable/Issuing Association - IMA(Kochi Chapter) Nobody can take risks when it comes to health. So, when someone is suffering from a health related issue, he/she will, most probably, consult an experienced and well renowned doctor. We usually ask our friends/relatives for recommendations on a good doctor or visit the highly rated hospital. Sometimes we even consult more than one doctor to get a second opinion regarding one's health issue. This practise can be time consuming and can be tiring as well. There are situations were the treatment should be given on time and in such a situation, this practise should not be followed. With KochiOrgBook, doctors will be issued a digital identity about who they are and what their qualification is and a normal citizen can access these informations from their fingertips. With this, an individual can make the best decisions on time and with ease. Lawyers Verifiable/Issuing Association - Bar Council of India(Kochi High Court Chapter) It is quite difficult to identity lawyers who are specialized in specific types of cases from public information as only their name and qualifications are made available. All lawyers may not be able to offer legal consultation services which makes it difficult for a citizen to approach the right lawyer without connections. This could take time and may impact the ability of an individual to contest legal claims at court efficiently. This use case is focused on enabling a citizen of the city of Kochi to verify that the Lawyer is qualified to handle or offer legal consultation on specific types of cases in a most efficient and trustworthy manner. Driving License\u200b Verifiable/Issuing Association - Regional Transport Office(Kochi) Anyone who needs to take up the driving license test should first prove their eligibility, mainly age. Other than age, one should give proof for their identity and address. Then the RTO department goes through the presented documents and declare one eligible, if they approve of it. This entire process can take up a lot of time and individuals will have to provide a number of documents to prove their eligibility and identity. This use case is focused on enabling a citizen to present digital proofs to take up driving license test leveraging capabilities of verifiable credentials and increase efficiency of the process. Verification services to provide specific digital identities Services - Email verification service, Phone number verification service, Address verification service Today, email-id and phone number are the most shared information throughout the internet. A person use their email-id/phone number to avail various services or share information or login to a particular website. But, even these credentials are misused for various illegal activities. This use case is focused on providing individual with basic verification services like Email verification service, Phone number verification service etc. With this each user can prove their ownership over their informations like email-id/phone number and they will be provided with a DID for these information which can be stored in a digital wallet app. Creating student credentials for applying admission to external Universities Verifiable/Issuing Association - Universities and Educational Institutions (Kochi) Often a student will have to share multiple credential information for applying admission to external universities. The student would need to apply and secure many of these credentials from different source independently. Not every student may be well versed with the formalities involved this and this results in students incurring delays and cost for securing all the required credentials for applying to external Universities. Lack of transparency in the process also causes some students to miss out on the requesting credentials in specific format which forces them to miss out on apply for admissions. This use case is focused on enabling a student to collect all required digital credentials /proofs and submit them in a timely manner leveraging a workflow which offers transparency, enhance efficiency, and reduces cost to apply for admissions. University issued digital credential Verifiable/Issuing Association - Universities and Educational Institutions (Kochi) In this use case, a student under a particular university will be issued a DID proving him/her a valid student under the university. By leveraging this DID, he/she can work through the university related processes with ease.","title":"Key Use Cases"},{"location":"gf_info/key_use_cases/#key-use-cases","text":"This initiative can work around a number of use cases under a particular jurisdiction.

If you have comments or suggestions, we invite you to submit them using our issue tracker. If you are interested in joining the KOB Consortium, please feel free to contact us. Version Control Version: 0.1 Governing Board Approval Date: TBD Comments: Ratification of the KOBPIU-GF will take place upon the formation of the Governing Board (at first meeting). Status: TBD Acknowledgements \u200bThis document was produced on behalf of the KOBPIU Governing Board by the KOBPIU Governance Framework Working Group. KOBPIU Governance Framework Master Document 1. INTRODUCTION The purpose of the KOBPIU is to provide a decentralized global public utility for trusted commerce. The KOBPIU-GF works as the constitution for the KOBPIU. It represents an instance of a ToIP Layer One Public Utility Governance Framework under the guidance of the ToIP Utility Foundry Working Group . The KOBPIU-GF leverages the principles, policies, terminology, and standards necessary to enable trusted digital commerce based on decentralized identity. A key objective of the KOBPIU-GF is to address any concerns or risks that consortium members may have as itility participants. The KOBPIU-GF formally consists of a set of interrelated documents shown in blue and yellow in Figure(). The KOB Consortia will also publish additional operational documents, including white papers, FAQs, readiness checklists, design guidelines, sample schemas, etc., as needed. The documents are organized in three categories; Blue = Normative, Yellow = Assessment, White = Informative. The normative documents in the KOBPIU-GF V1 are: KOBPOIU Governance Framework Master Document V1 - The present document. Five legal agreements: KOBPIU Steward Agreement V1 \u2014 The agreement between the KOB Consortia and all Stewards who operate Nodes of the KOBPIU. Transaction Author Agreement V1 \u2014 The agreement between the KOB Consortia and all Identity Owners writing Transactions to the KOBPIU Ledger Networks. Transaction Endorser Agreement V1 \u2014 The agreement between the KOB Consortia and Organizations using Permissioned Write Access. Steward Data Processing Agreement (DPA) V1 \u2014 The agreement under which Stewards serve as data processors from a data protection regulatory standpoint. Transaction Endorser Data Processing Agreement V1 \u2014 The DPA that applies to Transaction Endorsers. KOBPIU Glossary V1 \u2014 The terminology and definitions that apply to all KOBPIU-GF documents and across KOBPIU infrastructure as a whole. Controlled Documents \u2014 Technical specifications, standards, and policies that are independently maintained and versioned either by the KOB Consortia (e.g., the KOBPIU (TODO:-Change back) DID Method) or external standards bodies (e.g., W3C, OASIS). Another document, the KOBPIU Trust Assurance Framework , does not directly govern KOBPIU Infrastructure; rather it defines criteria and processes for assessing conformance of KOBPIU actors, including the KOB Consortia, to the policies of the KOBPIU-GF. 2. CORE PRINCIPLES The following principles guide the development of policies in the KOBPIU-GF 2.1 Self-Sovereignty Individuals are endowed with and possess an inalienable right to be Identity Owners with the ability to permanently control one or more Self-Sovereign Identities without reliance on any external administrative authority. An Identity Owner alone shall determine which Identity Data describe its Identities. With regard to managing its own Identity Data, an Identity Owner alone shall determine how and for what purpose(s) it is processed. An Identity Owner alone shall determine who has access to its Identity Data. An Identity Owner\u2019s Identity Data shall be portable as determined by the Identity Owner and enabled via Open Standards. An Identity Owner alone shall have the right to Delegate control of these functions. 2.2 Guardianship An Individual who does not have the capability to directly control that Individual\u2019s Identity Data (a Dependent) shall have the right to appoint another Identity Owner who has that capability (an Independent or an Organization) to serve as the owner\u2019s Guardian. If a Dependent does not have the capability to directly appoint a Guardian, the Dependent shall still have the right to have a Guardian appointed to act on the Dependent\u2019s behalf. A Dependent has the right tobecome an Independent by claiming full control of the Dependent\u2019s Identity Data. A Guardian has the obligation to promptly assist in this process provided the Dependent can demonstrate that the Dependent has the necessary capabilities. Guardianship shall not be confused with Delegation or Impersonation. Guardianship under the KOBPIU Governance Framework should be mapped in the proper contexts to various legal constructs, including legal guardianship , power of attorney , conservatorship , living trusts , and so on. 2.3 Openness and Interoperability KOBPIU Infrastructure shall use Open Standards and avoid mechanisms that would prevent Identity Owners from having interoperability or portability of their Identity Data both within the KOBPIU Network and with other networks and systems. 2.4 Accountability Identity Owners shall be accountable to each other for conformance to the purpose, principles, and policies of the KOBPIU Governance Framework. All KOBPIU Entities shall be responsible for and be able to demonstrate compliance with any other requirements of applicable law. Nothing in the KOBPIU Governance Framework shall require a KOBPIU Entity to breach applicable law in order for it to perform its obligations under the KOBPIU Governance Framework. 2.5 Sustainability KOBPIU Infrastructure shall be designed and operated to be technically, economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable for the long term. 2.6 Transparency The KOB Consortia shall practice Open Governance, and the KOB Consortia and the Stewards in their KOBPIU Ledger Roles shall operate with full openness and transparency to the greatest extent feasible consistent with the principles herein, including the proceedings of the KOBPIU Board of Trustees and all KOBPIU Governing Bodies, the development and distribution of KOBPIU Open Source Code, the qualification and operation of Stewards, and any revisions to the KOBPIU Governance Framework. 2.7 Collective Best Interest The KOB Consortia shall act in the collective best interests of all Identity Owners and shall not favor the interests of any single Identity Owner or group of Identity Owners over the interests of the KOB Consortia as a whole. Note that at present the KOBPIU Governance Framework has no self-enforcing distributed mechanism that neutralises differences of interest among different stakeholders participating in the network, therefore this is the responsibility of the KOB Consortia. Future versions of the KOBPIU Governance Framework shall aim to provide such mechanisms. 2.8 Decentralization by Design 2.8.1 General KOBPIU Infrastructure shall be decentralized to the greatest extent possible consistent with the other principles herein. As the business, legal, and technical limitations of decentralization may change over time, the KOB Consortia shall continuously examine all points of control, decision, and governance to seek ongoing conformance with this principle. 2.8.2 Diffuse Trust KOBPIU Infrastructure shall not concentrate power in any single Individual, Organization, Jurisdiction, Industry Sector, or other special interest to the detriment of the Network as a whole.

The KOBPIU-GF works as the constitution for the KOBPIU. It represents an instance of a ToIP Layer One Public Utility Governance Framework under the guidance of the ToIP Utility Foundry Working Group . The KOBPIU-GF leverages the principles, policies, terminology, and standards necessary to enable trusted digital commerce based on decentralized identity. A key objective of the KOBPIU-GF is to address any concerns or risks that consortium members may have as itility participants. The KOBPIU-GF formally consists of a set of interrelated documents shown in blue and yellow in Figure(). The KOB Consortia will also publish additional operational documents, including white papers, FAQs, readiness checklists, design guidelines, sample schemas, etc., as needed. The documents are organized in three categories; Blue = Normative, Yellow = Assessment, White = Informative. The normative documents in the KOBPIU-GF V1 are: KOBPOIU Governance Framework Master Document V1 - The present document. Five legal agreements: KOBPIU Steward Agreement V1 \u2014 The agreement between the KOB Consortia and all Stewards who operate Nodes of the KOBPIU. Transaction Author Agreement V1 \u2014 The agreement between the KOB Consortia and all Identity Owners writing Transactions to the KOBPIU Ledger Networks. Transaction Endorser Agreement V1 \u2014 The agreement between the KOB Consortia and Organizations using Permissioned Write Access. Steward Data Processing Agreement (DPA) V1 \u2014 The agreement under which Stewards serve as data processors from a data protection regulatory standpoint. Transaction Endorser Data Processing Agreement V1 \u2014 The DPA that applies to Transaction Endorsers. KOBPIU Glossary V1 \u2014 The terminology and definitions that apply to all KOBPIU-GF documents and across KOBPIU infrastructure as a whole. Controlled Documents \u2014 Technical specifications, standards, and policies that are independently maintained and versioned either by the KOB Consortia (e.g., the KOBPIU (TODO:-Change back) DID Method) or external standards bodies (e.g., W3C, OASIS). Another document, the KOBPIU Trust Assurance Framework , does not directly govern KOBPIU Infrastructure; rather it defines criteria and processes for assessing conformance of KOBPIU actors, including the KOB Consortia, to the policies of the KOBPIU-GF.","title":"1.

The KOBPIU Governance Framework and KOBPIU Glossary (Add link to glossary) is incorporated into this Agreement by reference only for purposes of use of such defined terms. 2)Permission to Write to the KOBPIU Ledger Networks The KOB Consortia hereby grants to Transaction Author a non-exclusive, non-assignable, non-sublicensable, royalty free, revocable license to write to and use the KOBPIU Ledger Networks in accordance with this Agreement and the KOBPIU Governance Framework. When authoring Transactions under the policy of Permissioned Write Access, a Transaction Author may only write to the KOBPIU Ledger Networks by using an authorized Transaction Endorser. In the event that KOB Consortia enables Public Write Access to the KOBPIU Ledger Networks, the Transaction Author will not need a Transaction Endorser to endorse a Transaction. Once an initial Transaction has been written to one of the KOBPIU Ledger Networks by the Transaction Author (\u201cInitial Transaction\u201d), the Transaction Author is granted permission to make additional Transactions to update the state of a previous Transaction (\u201cUpdate Transactions\u201d). Please note, an Update Transaction does not remove the Initial Transaction, which will remain on the KOBPIU Ledger due to its immutability and may remain on KOBPIU Test Networks unless they are reset. Transaction Author may make Update Transactions if and only if the Transaction Author was the author of the Initial Transaction. Update Transactions are Transactions and are subject to all the terms of this Agreement. 3) Transaction Author Obligations With regard to all Transactions, Transaction Author will: comply with any requirements imposed by the Transaction Endorser on the Transaction Author and any Transactions endorsed by the Transaction Endorser; not write Transactions containing Personal Data until KOB Consortia approves Public Write Access and permits Transactions to contain Personal Data pursuant to Section 3(b) below. If the KOB Consortia approves Public Write Access and permits Transaction Authors to write Transactions that contain Permissible Personal Data (\u201cPersonal Data Transactions\u201d), then Transaction Author expressly agrees that: It will not write any Transactions that contain Impermissible Personal Data to the KOBPIU Ledger Networks; it is an independent data controller (as defined in the GDPR) of the Personal Data Transactions and will be responsible for the lawfulness of the Processing of such data in compliance with the Data Protection Laws; it acknowledges and will notify all data subjects whose Personal Data it Processes that functions inherent in blockchain technology may render fulfilling data subject requests difficult or impossible. For example, due to blockchain\u2019s immutability, data stored on a blockchain generally cannot be removed or altered once the data is confirmed on the blockchain; it irrevocably waives any and all claims, rights and/or obligations it may have now or in the future against the KOB Consortia as a result of being unable to fulfill data subject requests in accordance with Data Protection Laws; it agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions applicable to Transaction Author as a controller of Personal Data Transactions under the Data Processing Agreements with Stewards and Transaction Endorsers, each in their roles as processors under the GDPR, and attached as Appendices A and B (the \u201cDPAs\u201d); that the KOB Consortia has the right to enter into the DPAs on its behalf and the DPAs are made a part of the Agreement in their entirety; by signing this Agreement, each Party is deemed to have signed the DPAs, including the Standard Contractual Clauses with the KOB Consortia and Transaction Author as the \u201cData exporter,\u201d and with either a Steward or a Transaction Endorser as \u201cData importer,\u201d as applicable; at the KOB Consortia\u2019s request, the Transaction Author will reimburse the KOB Consortia for any costs incurred by the KOB Consortia in enforcing the Transaction Author\u2019s rights under the GDPR, including but not limited to fulfillment of data subject rights, rights of oversight and audit, etc.; and it irrevocably waives any and all claims that it may have now or in the future that the KOB Consortia lacks the rights to enter into the DPAs on its behalf and bind Transaction Author to the DPAs\u2019 terms and conditions, including the limitation of liability therein. 4) Term and Termination This Agreement commences on the Effective Date and shall remain in force until terminated by either Party pursuant to this Section 4 (Term and Termination). Either Party may terminate this Agreement: (i) if the other Party has materially defaulted in the performance of any of its obligations under this Agreement and has not cured such default within fifteen (15) business days of receipt of written notice from the non-defaulting Party of such default or (ii) immediately in the event of any government sanctions or other legal measures that make it unlawful for Transaction Author to write Transactions to the KOBPIU Ledger Networks. Additionally, Transaction Author may terminate this Agreement upon 30 days\u2019 advance written notice to the KOB Consortia and ceasing all use of the KOBPIU Ledger Networks. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason the rights granted to Transaction Author by the KOB Consortia under this Agreement automatically terminate. 5) Representations and Warranties; Disclaimer By KOB Consortia.
