The mission of the ToIP foundation is to simplify and standardize how trust is established online so that everyone can feel safe, secure, and private in all of our digital interactions \u2014 whether between individuals, businesses, governments, or any \u201cthing\u201d on the Internet of Things. DID \u2013 Decentralized Identifier DIDs are globally unique identifiers that are created by their owner, independent of any central authority. Each DID has associated with it one or more public keys created by the DID owner (and the owner holds the corresponding private keys), and one or more endpoints - addresses where messages can be delivered for that identity. A DID can be uniquely resolved (like a URL) to return the the data (public keys and endpoints) associated with the DID. Agents and Wallets It is hard to manage all the DIDs a person creates or receives. Indy uses the term \"Agent\" to mean the software that interacts with other entities, and the term \"Wallet\" as a data store for the DIDs and related information. For example, a person might have a mobile Agent app on their smart devices, while an Organization might have an enterprise Agent running on a Cloud Server. All Agents have a secure Wallet for storing identity data. A personal Agent wallet is similar to a password manager - there is a name for each relationship and associated data. However, unlike Password Managers that use things like your copy/paste clipboard for User IDs and Passwords and \"screen-scrape\" applications and websites, Agents communicate directly with Agents to accomplish Identity-related tasks. The picture below is an example of some communicating Indy Agents. The Edge Agents are handled by the Identity owners themselves - in this case a Consumer and an Enterprise. The Cloud Agents facilitate the messaging by, for example, providing a permanent endpoint for a device that may or may not be online at the time messages are being received. Credential Credentials are things like driver's licenses, passports, or university degrees that are given to us from an issuing authority that we can use to show to others when needed. Verifiable Credential(VC) VCs are digital equivalents of paper credentials that are cryptographically processed such that when we show (\"prove\") the claims (data elements from the Credentials), the receiver (\"Verifier\") can be certain: - Who issued the claims - That the claims were issued to the Identity presenting them - That the claims have not been tampered with (forged), and - That the claims' Credential has not been revoked by the Issuer. As the image below shows, the data flow for Verifiable Credentials is the same as with paper documents - Issuers give Verifiable Credentials to the Holder, and the Holder can prove them to Verifiers at any time. Issuer, Holder, Verifier Issuer - Issues Verifiable Credentials to the Holder Holder - Holders request credentials from issuers, hold them in their wallets and present them when requested by verifiers Verifier - Verifies the claims presented by the Holder TIP \u2013 Trust over IP Interoperability Profile\u200b A TIP represents a specific combination of technologies that span each of the four layers of the ToIP technology stack in order to meet the requirements of a set of target customers in one or more digital trust ecosystems. TIPs can be designed, refined and supported by multiple vendors and customers wishing to collaborate on interoperability. TSWG \u2013 Technology Stack Working Group\u200b This working group (members) concerns a broadly defined and broadly applicable set of technologies (the \"stack of technology\") that can be used to promote the ability of project-level scientists to build web-based data and processing services that are readily found and used by others. Part of this effort is to promote interoperability between individual services in order to help scientists pursue more integrated science. GDPR - General Data Protection Regulation\u200b General Data Protection Regulation is meant to fundamentally reshape how personal data are collected and processed by giving all individuals living in the European Union (or the greater European Economic Area) new rights to access and control their data on the Internet. Identity Utility Network An Identity Utility Network associated with a DID Root Namespace that operates under its own Governance Framework. Digital Trust Ecosystem An interdependent group of enterprises, people and/or things that share a standardized trust model for mutually beneficial purposes, such as consumer and commercial interactions that are verifiable. DID Namespace Building on URI Standards, the DID Specification allows for both root namespace (did:xxx) and sub-namespace (did:xxx:yyy) conventions. Node A computer network server running an instance of the code necessary to operate a distributed ledger or blockchain. Browser wars A browser war is competition for dominance in the usage share of web browsers. With the introduction of HTML5 and CSS 3, a new generation of browser war began, this time adding extensive client-side scripting to the World Wide Web, as well as more widespread use of smartphones and other mobile devices for browsing the web. These newcomers have ensured that browser battles continue among enthusiasts, while the average web user is less affected.

A few of the key use cases are listed below. Medical Practitioners Verifiable/Issuing Association - IMA(Kochi Chapter) Nobody can take risks when it comes to health. So, when someone is suffering from a health related issue, he/she will, most probably, consult an experienced and well renowned doctor. We usually ask our friends/relatives for recommendations on a good doctor or visit the highly rated hospital. Sometimes we even consult more than one doctor to get a second opinion regarding one's health issue. This practise can be time consuming and can be tiring as well. There are situations were the treatment should be given on time and in such a situation, this practise should not be followed. With KochiOrgBook, doctors will be issued a digital identity about who they are and what their qualification is and a normal citizen can access these informations from their fingertips. With this, an individual can make the best decisions on time and with ease. Lawyers Verifiable/Issuing Association - Bar Council of India(Kochi High Court Chapter) It is quite difficult to identity lawyers who are specialized in specific types of cases from public information as only their name and qualifications are made available. All lawyers may not be able to offer legal consultation services which makes it difficult for a citizen to approach the right lawyer without connections. This could take time and may impact the ability of an individual to contest legal claims at court efficiently. This use case is focused on enabling a citizen of the city of Kochi to verify that the Lawyer is qualified to handle or offer legal consultation on specific types of cases in a most efficient and trustworthy manner. Driving License\u200b Verifiable/Issuing Association - Regional Transport Office(Kochi) Anyone who needs to take up the driving license test should first prove their eligibility, mainly age. Other than age, one should give proof for their identity and address. Then the RTO department goes through the presented documents and declare one eligible, if they approve of it. This entire process can take up a lot of time and individuals will have to provide a number of documents to prove their eligibility and identity. This use case is focused on enabling a citizen to present digital proofs to take up driving license test leveraging capabilities of verifiable credentials and increase efficiency of the process. Verification services to provide specific digital identities Services - Email verification service, Phone number verification service, Address verification service Today, email-id and phone number are the most shared information throughout the internet. A person use their email-id/phone number to avail various services or share information or login to a particular website. But, even these credentials are misused for various illegal activities. This use case is focused on providing individual with basic verification services like Email verification service, Phone number verification service etc. With this each user can prove their ownership over their informations like email-id/phone number and they will be provided with a DID for these information which can be stored in a digital wallet app. Creating student credentials for applying admission to external Universities Verifiable/Issuing Association - Universities and Educational Institutions (Kochi) Often a student will have to share multiple credential information for applying admission to external universities. The student would need to apply and secure many of these credentials from different source independently. Not every student may be well versed with the formalities involved this and this results in students incurring delays and cost for securing all the required credentials for applying to external Universities. Lack of transparency in the process also causes some students to miss out on the requesting credentials in specific format which forces them to miss out on apply for admissions. This use case is focused on enabling a student to collect all required digital credentials /proofs and submit them in a timely manner leveraging a workflow which offers transparency, enhance efficiency, and reduces cost to apply for admissions. University issued digital credential Verifiable/Issuing Association - Universities and Educational Institutions (Kochi) In this use case, a student under a particular university will be issued a DID proving him/her a valid student under the university. By leveraging this DID, he/she can work through the university related processes with ease.","title":"Key Use Cases"},{"location":"key_use_cases/#key-use-cases","text":"This initiative can work around a number of use cases under a particular jurisdiction.
